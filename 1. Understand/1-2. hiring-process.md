**<ins>Platform:</ins>** Applications are submitted through job boards.  
**<ins>Referral:</ins>** Current employees recommend potential candidates.

<br />

## ðŸ“® Inbound Process

<br />

### 1. <i>Job Description Creation</i>
Commonly known as a JD, job description is usually crafted through these steps:

1. The hiring committee (including Hiring Manager, HR, Engineering Manager, and CTO) determines the required roles and the number of positions to be filled.
2. The hiring manager collects and refines the job requirements from each team lead or manager.
3. The hiring manager either writes the job description themselves or seeks help from a recruiter or staffing agency.

<br />

### 2. <i>Job Posting</i>
The job opening is posted on Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and various job board platforms (LinkedIn Jobs, Indeed, etc.), making it available for applicants to apply.

<br />

### 3. <i>Resume/Application Submission</i>
Applicants submit their resumes and applications through different platforms.

<br />

### 4. <i>ATS Filtering</i>
The resumes submitted by candidates are filtered and sorted through the ATS.

<br />

### 5. <i>Resume Review by Recruiter</i>
Resumes filtered by the ATS are initially reviewed by the recruiter, who evaluates the following:

1. <ins>Does the applicant meet the criteria defined by the Hiring Manager?</ins>
    - e.g., `At least 5 years of experience`, `Required experience in Distributed Systems`, `Proficiency in React.js`, etc.
2. <ins>Is the candidate capable of performing the job responsibilities?</ins>
3. <ins>Is the candidate worth inviting for an interview?</ins>

<br />

### 6. <i>Recruiter Call</i>
The recruiter holds a short call or Zoom meeting, usually lasting 15 to 30 minutes, to verify key information and determine if the candidate should move forward in the process:

1. Confirm important details from the resume, such as experience, tech stack, and basic communication skills.
2. Verify additional information not on the resume, like visa status or location.
3. Ensure the candidate meets the essential requirements outlined by the hiring manager.
4. Check if the candidate's expectations align with the open position.
5. Assess the candidate's job search status and availability.

<br />

### 7. <i>OA (Online Assessment)</i>
Since hiring managers, such as Engineering Managers or VPs of Engineering, often handle recruitment alongside their main responsibilities, <ins>companies use online assessments to screen technical skills and save the hiring manager's time by filtering out unqualified candidates.</ins>

These assessments vary by company but often include algorithm and data structure coding tests similar to LeetCode. Other formats may include mini-projects, pair programming, low-level design challenges, or technical quizzes

<br />

### 8. <i>Resume Review by Hiring Manager</i>
<ins>The final stage of resume evaluation</ins> is conducted by the hiring manager. Resumes of candidates who pass the recruiter call and online assessment are forwarded to the hiring manager for further review. Only those who clear this stage advance to the interview process.

In some companies, the hiring manager might skip the resume review entirely and move directly to the hiring manager interview stage.

<br />

### 9. <i>Hiring Manager Interview and Next Steps</i>
The hiring manager interview is the final stage of resume-based evaluation. The depth of questions about work experience and technical skills can vary depending on the hiring manager's expertise, and the interview typically lasts less than an hour.

If the candidate passes this stage, the company commits more resourcesâ€”such as time and interview costsâ€”into the full interview process, which may include live coding, system design, and behavioral interviews.
