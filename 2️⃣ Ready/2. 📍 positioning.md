## 🤷‍♀️ Why is positioning important?

Companies and hiring managers aren't just looking for a "great software engineer" or a "software engineer with 5 years of experience." They're looking to hire **<ins>the right software engineer for their team's specific needs</ins>**.

While the JD may not list every detail, <ins>you should align with it as much as possible while showcasing your strengths and experience</ins>.
