## ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Why use multiple versions?

Many candidates use a single version of their resume for all job applications. While this is convenient, it can greatly reduce your chances of getting past the screening stage.

To improve your odds, you need to tailor your resume to the job description (JD) of each position you apply for. However, when applying to **hundreds of companies**, creating a unique resume for each is not practical.

This chapter covers how to **efficiently create and manage multiple versions of your resume** while applying to many jobs.

## ‚úÖ How to Get Started

### 1. *Create a Master Resume*
- Start by writing a <ins>**comprehensive master resume**</ins> that includes **all of your skills, experiences, and accomplishments**. There's no need to worry about length at this stage.
- When making other versions, you can simply <ins>**trim the master resume**</ins> by removing irrelevant details, allowing you to quickly tailor your resume for specific roles.
- In your master resume, try to <ins>**describe each experience from multiple perspectives**.</ins>
    - For instance, if you completed a project, write about the results, teamwork, leadership, and other key aspects. This will make it easier to create targeted resumes by focusing on different strengths.

<br />

### 2. *Save Resume Versions in Cloud Storage*
- Often, job notifications arrive while you're away from your computer, and you may need to apply quickly from your phone. If your resume is only saved on your computer, it can slow you down.
- By saving all versions of your resume in cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive or iCloud), you can **easily access and submit the right version** from anywhere.
- Resume files are small, so free cloud storage options should be more than enough to store your versions.
