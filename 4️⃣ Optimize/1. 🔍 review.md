## 🤷‍♀️ Why is Feedback Important?

Getting feedback on your resume is crucial to improving its effectiveness.

You might think your resume reads well because you've reviewed it many times, but <ins>fresh eyes can easily catch awkward phrasing, unclear wording, or unnecessary details.</ins>

Feedback from people experienced in reviewing resumes or conducting interviews can <ins>help you focus on job-specific keywords and remove unnecessary content to keep your resume clear and concise.</ins>

If it's your first time writing a resume or you haven't had anyone review it, getting feedback is highly recommended.
