## ‚úçÔ∏è Writing Guide

### 1. *Leadership and Awards*
- Include the name of the award, the organization that granted it, and the date.
- If you have leadership experience, mention the project or team you led and your specific role.
- Avoid listing common awards that may not stand out, as resume reviewers tend to focus more on work experience than awards.

<br />

### 2. *Certifications*
- Certifications from platforms like Udemy, Coursera, Udacity, or LinkedIn typically don't hold much weight with reviewers.
    - However, if you're lacking experience, these can help demonstrate your commitment to learning and development.
- <ins>If certifications are a required qualification for the role, make sure to highlight them prominently so they catch the reviewer's attention.</ins>

<br />

### 3. *Research Experience / Publications*
- For research roles, particularly if you have a master's degree or higher, include your research and publications.
- When listing them, include the paper title, conference name, and publication date.
- <ins>If you've published an SCI-level paper or presented at a major international conference, consider placing this section higher on your resume.</ins>
- Provide links to your papers if available.
- Focus on the research topic, your role (especially if you're a co-author), and the results of your work.

<br />

### 4. *Patents*
- If you have patents, list the patent name, number, and filing date.
- For co-patents, it's not necessary to list the names of other inventors.
- <ins>If a patent is particularly relevant to the job or company, consider placing it near the top of your resume.</ins>
