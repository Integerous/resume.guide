## üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è What is the Projects Section?
The Projects section is where you showcase your **personal/team projects, open-source contributions**, and more.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>**For entry-level software engineers without work experience:** 
>  
>If you don't have internship experience, you can format your Projects section similarly to the Work Experience section.

## ‚úÖ When Projects Are Beneficial for Experienced Software Engineers

While the Work Experience section is key for experienced software engineers, adding a Projects section can be valuable in the following cases:

1. When the project is <ins>**directly relevant to the company, team, or role**</ins> you're applying for.
2. If the project involves <ins>**technologies heavily featured in the job description**.</ins>
3. If you've contributed to a <ins>**well-known open-source project**</ins> with a large user base.
4. If the project has a <ins>**wide user base**</ins>, showcasing your skills.
5. If you're shifting your career focus and have used <ins>**new technologies not reflected in your previous work experience**.</ins>
6. If you've done freelance work and feel it doesn't fit naturally in the Work Experience section. You can list these under Projects instead. (See GitFront below for more details.)


<br />

## ‚úçÔ∏è Writing Guide

### 1. *Limit to 3 Projects*
- Since the Work Experience section carries more weight, especially for experienced software engineers or new grads with internship experience, <ins>**limit the Projects section to 3 projects**.</ins>
- If you don't have internship experience, it's recommended to format the Projects section similarly to a Work Experience section.

<br />

### 2. *Provide Descriptions*
- For personal or smaller open-source projects, include a brief overview.
- For team projects, clearly outline <ins>**your role and contributions**.</ins>
- Make sure the <ins>**key technologies**</ins> used are easy to spot.
- It's a good idea to have a clean <ins>**README file**</ins>, as reviewers might check it. They may not dig into the code, but a well-prepared README leaves a positive impression.

<br />

### 3. *Include Links*
- If the project is live, include a link so the reviewer can check it out.
- If the code is public, share the **GitHub/GitLab repository link**.

<br />

### 4. *Use GitFront for Private Repositories*
- If your code is private, you can use [GitFront](https://gitfront.io/) to share repositories (as long as there are no NDA or confidentiality concerns).
- GitFront allows you to share private repos, with access restricted to those with the link.
- GitFront is free for up to 3 projects, making it a great option for sharing private projects on your resume.

<br />

### 5. *Exclude Standard School Assignments*
- **<ins>Avoid listing standard school assignments</ins>**, as they might not highlight your passion or skills effectively.
- However, if the project was self-directed or open-ended, feel free to include it.
- If you built and maintained a service that solved a problem at your school, it's a strong addition to your resume.
- Examples: A school dining menu sharing service, a class review platform, or an internal community service.
