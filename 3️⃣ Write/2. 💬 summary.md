<br />

## üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è What is the Summary / Objective Section?
- This section typically appears right below your name and contact information.
- The main focus is to:
    - <ins>Showcase how your experience, accomplishments, and skills can add value to the company/team/position you're applying for</ins>
    - <ins>Emphasize how well you fit the position</ins>
    - Highlight your desired career path and goals
    - Provide a brief career story that might not be fully captured in the rest of your resume

>[!NOTE]
>**Summary vs Objective ? ü§î**
>  
>While Summary and Objective sections serve similar purposes and can be used interchangeably, there are subtle differences:
>  - **Summary**: Focuses on your career achievements and how they can benefit the company/team/position, and demonstrates your fit for the role.
>  - **Objective**: Highlights your desired career path and goals.

## ‚ùå Usually Not Necessary
For most applicants, a Summary/Objective section isn't needed.

- <ins>Resume reviewers often skip over this section because it tends to be filled with buzzwords. </ins>
- If your career path is clear in the Work Experience section, there's no need to include a Summary/Objective section.
- However, there are situations where a Summary/Objective section can be helpful (see below).
- It's a good idea to include this section on your LinkedIn profile, where space isn't as limited.

## ‚úÖ When It Can Be Helpful

### 1. *Extensive Experience*
If you have a lot of experience and your resume spans two pages, or if your Work Experience section is too detailed to quickly grasp, a Summary/Objective section can help provide a concise overview.

<br />

### 2. *Career Change*
If you've switched careers, such as moving from a different field to software engineering, or transitioning from a managerial track to an IC (Individual Contributor) track, a Summary/Objective section can explain the reasons behind your career change and make it easier for the resume reviewer to understand your journey.

<br />

### 3. *Entry-Level Software Engineers*
For entry-level software engineers with limited content for their resume, writing a Summary/Objective section can help make better use of space and provide additional context about your qualifications.

<br />

### 4. *Relevant Experience or Story*
If you have a unique experience or story that directly relates to the job or company you're applying to, mentioning it in the Summary/Objective section can be useful. For example, if you're applying to Uber and have experience as an Uber driver, it could be worth mentioning.

<br />

### 5. *Specific Job Role or Work Arrangement Preferences*
If you're targeting a specific role or type of work, it's helpful to mention this in the Summary/Objective section. While this can be a double-edged sword, as it may lead to quick rejections if the position isn't available, it can also increase your chances of moving forward if the desired role is actively being hired for.

Similarly, if you prefer a specific office location or only want to work remotely, you can mention that in the Summary/Objective section.
