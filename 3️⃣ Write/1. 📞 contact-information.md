## ✅ What to Include

### 1. <i>Name</i>
- List your first and last name in that order.
- 🔒 [Should I use an English name?](https://www.resume.guide/en/write/contact-information#-should-i-use-an-english-name/?ref=github.com)

<br />

### 2. <i>Phone Number</i>
- Typically written in one of the following formats:
    - `(123) 456-7890`
    - `+1 (123) 456-7890`
    - `123-456-7890`
- <ins>It's best to avoid using an international phone number.</ins>
    - A number with a country code other than `+1` could result in your resume being rejected immediately.
    - As an international candidate, you might be eliminated early due to the additional costs of relocation and visa sponsorship, as well as the potential communication challenges for recruiters or hiring managers.

<br />

### 3. <i>Email Address</i>
- Use a personal email address that you will continue using long-term.
- Gmail is generally the safest option.
- If you need to create a new email, it's best to use one that includes your first and last name, like `john.doe@gmail.com`.

<br />

### 4. <i>Location</i>
- Include just your city, state, and zip code.
- There's no need to include your full address, and the zip code is optional.
- If you live outside the U.S., it's best not to include your address on your resume.
- If you're living abroad and don't have a U.S. address:
  >1. Use a temporary address in the area where you plan to relocate.
  >2. If you haven't chosen a location yet, use an address in the San Francisco Bay Area, where there's high demand for software engineers.
  >3. Alternatively, use an address that's within an hour's drive of the company you're applying to.

<br />

### 5. <i>LinkedIn Profile</i>
- The default LinkedIn URL (e.g., ***linkedin.com/in/john-doe-967b3072***) is too long and cluttered. Shorten it by following the steps in [LinkedIn's guide to customizing your profile URL](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a542685/manage-your-public-profile-url?lang=en).
- A concise URL that includes your first and last name works best, like <ins>**linkedin.com/in/JohnDoe**</ins>.
    - LinkedIn URLs are not case-sensitive, so capitalizing the first letters of your name can make it easier to read.
- Make sure to hyperlink your LinkedIn profile so that recruiters can click on it directly from your resume. 

<br />

## 🟨 Optional Items

### 1. <i>GitHub Profile</i>
- If you don't actively maintain your GitHub or don't have any projects worth showcasing, it's best not to include it.
- Pin your best projects to the top of your profile and organize your README.md files neatly.
- If you're a maintainer or a major contributor to open-source projects, it's worth mentioning on your resume.
- Translate any project names and README.md content written in Korean into English.
- If you have a significant number of followers, recruiters may ask what project gained you such a following.

<br />

### 2. <i>StackOverflow Profile</i>
- If you're highly active on StackOverflow, including your profile is a good idea.

<br />

### 3. <i>Personal Website</i>
- If you have a personal blog or portfolio website, feel free to include it.
- Only include links that directly support your technical experience and qualifications.
  - Avoid linking to blogs or YouTube channels that are unrelated to development.

<br />

## ❌ What to Avoid

### 1. <i>Do Not Include</i>
- Age
- Gender
- Marital status
- Whether you have children
- Religion
- Nationality
- Photo
- Personal hobbies or interests unrelated to your career

### 2. <i>🔒 Visa Status</i>

<br />

### 3. <i>Don't Use a School Email Address</i>
- Some schools that use Google's G Suite for Education allow students to keep using their school email addresses with Gmail. However, recent changes to Google's pricing policies have led some schools to stop providing email access to graduates. This has caused people to lose important information—like interview links—during the hiring process.
- As mentioned earlier, it’s best to use a personal email address that you plan to keep long-term.

<br />

### 4. <i>Check for Broken Links and Typos</i>
- Before submitting your resume, test all the links in your PDF to make sure they work.
  - Submitting a resume with broken links can reflect poorly on you as a software engineer.
- Double-check your phone number and email address for typos. Even small errors can prevent recruiters from contacting you and could cost you interview opportunities.
